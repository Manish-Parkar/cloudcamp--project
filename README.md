# AWS S3 Bucket Vulnerability
This is my first AWS CTF Challenge which I have completed during my 7 Day Long Bootcamp on Python and Cloud Security. In this project, I have created a VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment Penetration Testing) Report of an AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) Bucket by exploiting an intentionally vulnerable S3 service on flaws.cloud which provides some intensionally vulnerable AWS or Cloud Services for practicing the Cloud CTF and I have also created a Guide on, How to create an AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) Instance.
